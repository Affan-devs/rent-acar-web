successfully completed a hackathon project within 24 hours, creating a fully responsive website using Next.js, Framer Motion, shadcn, and Tailwind CSS, along with other modern tools. The project includes five pages, including the home page.

On the home page, clicking "Explore All" or "Browse Products" navigates users to the categories page. The categories page initially displays the first 8 products, with the option to reveal 4 additional products by clicking the "Load More" button.

For the second product on the home page, Nissan GT, clicking the "Rent Now" button directs users to the payment page. Additionally, another "Rent Now" button is placed at the bottom of the page, which redirects users to the admin page when clicked.

Within the categories page, selecting the Nissan car product navigates users to the product details page, where more in-depth information about the product is available.
